# [CORE-669] Add permission to create ingress

**eak12913** commented *Apr 6, 2023*

## Description

Adds a permission that's required for creating ingresses. The reason we needed this is because the K8s deployer that's used in dogfood accounts will `apply` both Aperture and mission-control k8s services. Those services create ingresses so if the deployer doesn't have this permission then it can't function. Note: This was previously not required in older versions of EKS but is now needed.

For reference permissions for `ingress` used to be granted via the `extensions` API and now are in the `networking.k8s.io`.
