# Port over namespace modules from terraform-kubernetes-helm

**yorinasub17** commented *Dec 15, 2020*

This ports over the namespace modules from [terraform-kubernetes-helm](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-kubernetes-helm) to this new repo. The modules have also been renamed to drop redundancy:

- `k8s-namespace` => `namespace`
- `k8s-namespace-roles` => `namespace-roles`
- `k8s-service-account` => `service-account`

The following changes were also introduced as a part of this porting:

- The modules now work with terraform 0.13.x.
- Resource rename: `rbac_tiller_metadata_access_role` => `rbac_helm_metadata_access_role`
- Resource rename: `rbac_tiller_resource_access_role` => `rbac_helm_resource_access_role`

Thanks for the review! Going to merge this now since the tests are passing and will draft the release notes + migration guide.
