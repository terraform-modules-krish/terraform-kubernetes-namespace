Looks like the build failed. I'll investigate.

Found the issue. The image `tutum/curl` used in [this fixture](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-kubernetes-namespace/blob/main/test/kubefixtures/curl-kubeapi-as-service-account.yml.tpl#L15) has been renamed to [curlimages/curl](https://hub.docker.com/r/curlimages/curl). It'll pass once you switch that.
